# QR Code Component

This project is a simple QR code component built as part of a challenge from ![Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). It is designed to improve front-end skills by building practical, real-world projects. The component features a QR code that, when scanned, directs users to the Frontend Mentor website to further enhance their coding skills.
